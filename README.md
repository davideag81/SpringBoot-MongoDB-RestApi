# Getting Started - BACKEND TUTORIAL SPRING BOOT - MONGO DB - REST API

### These are APIs that we need to provide:


Methods	Urls	Actions
POST	/api/tutorials	create new Tutorial
GET	/api/tutorials	retrieve all Tutorials
GET	/api/tutorials/:id	retrieve a Tutorial by :id
PUT	/api/tutorials/:id	update a Tutorial by :id
DELETE	/api/tutorials/:id	delete a Tutorial by :id
DELETE	/api/tutorials	delete all Tutorials
GET	/api/tutorials/published	find all published Tutorials

– We make CRUD operations & finder methods using Spring Data MongoDB.
– Rest Controller will be created with the help of Spring Web MVC.
